# steganography
A steganography programme written in python (3.5.2).

prerequisites:
-python (works on 3.5.2)
-PIL/Image (pip3 install Image)
-webcolors (pip3 install webcolors)

All image files must be in the 'files' folder. The image into which you hide your message and the converted message must both be in there. You don't need to put the 'files/' when giving names of files nor do you need to put the '.converted' onto ones that you're retrieving from.
